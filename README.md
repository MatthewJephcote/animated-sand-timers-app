# Animated Sand Timer App #

## Instructions ##

Simply load page and watch the four sand timers mark out 45 seconds.

## Technologies Employed ##

React, Tailwind and Pure CSS.

My design of the timer's graphics was achieved using CSS solely (with no image files whatsoever used in the project).

The app showcases my understanding of CSS Animations combining three types of these: rotation (as the timers flip over); filling-emptying (as the'sands of time' pass from the upper to lower chambers of the timers); and shake effect (which the timers use to indicate only 10 seconds remaining).

React 'reusability' allowed me to display multiple sand timers (each a variation on my SandTimer component) on the same page quickly and efficiently.

## How I Would Like To Take the Project Further ##

I would like to introduce a 'staggered start' feature to the timers. I believe that I could achieve this using JavaScript Timeout function combined with conditional operators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
